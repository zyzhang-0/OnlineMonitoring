****************************************************
Binaries for storing (and retrieving) OnlinePlots QA
graphics files to (from) the RunLog database
****************************************************

The binary files stored here as...
  storeOnlQAHistos
  storeOnlQAHistosToOnlDB
...appear to work, but the source code specifically
used to compile these particular versions has been
lost. A much older version of the storeOnlQAHistos.cc
source code was found, modified to perform the task
just like storeOnlQAHistosToOnlDB, and has been
archived in a different location in CVS which is
not built with the main STAR software library (which,
at the time of this writing, OnlTools/OnlinePlots is).
That alternate location under CVS is at:

  online/DataBase/onlDbLoad/

Upon checking out that code, one should be able to
type 'make all' in the directory where the codes
are located, and obtain fresh binaries. This has been
tested to work on rcas, evp.starp, and onl01.starp
as of Feb. 2010. In addition to the binary for...
  storeOnlQAHistosToOnlDB
...a binary will also be generated for...
  getOnlQAHistos
...which can be used to download a QA graphics file
from the RunLog database. Execute either command
with no options for help.
